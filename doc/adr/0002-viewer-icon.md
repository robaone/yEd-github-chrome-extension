# 2. Viewer icon

Date: 2020-07-09

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need a SVG icon for the file view page.

## Decision

1. We will create an icon that matches the yEd live icon in SVG format
   * It must look good when scaled down to 16 x 16 pixels
   
### Reference

There are some good examples of scaled SVG images at the following urls.
* https://css-tricks.com/scale-svg/
* https://www.google.com/search?q=scale+svg+to+fit+div&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS893US893&oq=scale+svg+&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l6j69i60.6282j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8

## Consequences

* We will have an image that can be embedded into the Github page by the chrome extension.
